**Technologies:** Python, LangGraph, Streamlit, OpenAI APIs

### [Web-Enhanced RAG](https://github.com/mateusdtakayama/web-enhanced-rag)
A RAG agent platform that combines web search capabilities with vector database retrieval. Uses LangChain for agent orchestration, Tavily for web search, and Qdrant for semantic search to provide comprehensive information retrieval.

**Technologies:** NestJS, LangChain, Qdrant, Tavily, TypeScript, Python

### [Reflection Agent](https://github.com/mateusdtakayama/reflection-agent-mastra)
An intelligent reflection agent that analyzes its own responses, identifies issues, and iteratively improves its output. Features generator, reflector, and refiner agents working together in a multi-iteration refinement cycle with automatic quality scoring.

**Technologies:** TypeScript, Mastra, OpenAI APIs, Node.js
